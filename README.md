# Game-Of-Life

A GUI based Game of Life Simulator.

Game of Life is a cellular automaton game developed by mathematician John Conway. It is played on a grid consisting of cells that can be either alive or dead. The game follows a set of rules that determine the state of each cell in the next generation based on its current state and the states of its eight neighboring cells. These rules involve concepts like birth, death, and survival.


# Rules for Game of Life 
In each iteration or generation of the game, cells may die or become alive depending on the number of neighboring cells that are alive. If a live cell has fewer than two live neighbors, it dies due to underpopulation. If it has more than three live neighbors, it dies due to overcrowding. On the other hand, a dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive due to reproduction. Cells that survive or remain dead in the next generation continue the cycle.
